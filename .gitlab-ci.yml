# Workflow:
# - on MR creation: run build and test stages. Pipeline needs to finish successfully before merge is allowed
# - on commit to main: run CI (build + test) and CD (deploy) part
# Options for improvement:
# - use semantic versioning
# - separate pipeline into 'CI' (triggers automatically after commit to main)...
#   - push build artifacts into 'Artifacts' storage and give each a correctly increased version number + release notes (based on commit messages)
# - and CD part (triggers either automatically or manually to deploy the latest or a selected version onto the target system)
# - ideally, have staging systems such as pre-prod or qa for testing purposes

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
