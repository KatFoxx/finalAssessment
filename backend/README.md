If you also need to set up the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration

Ensure that you have a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```bash
MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
```

### 4. Running the Application

Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

If you are serving the frontend with the backend:
